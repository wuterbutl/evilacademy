<h4>Here is a list of things to do to be evil: <a href=https://www.wikihow.com/Act-Evil target="_blank">Source</a></h4>

<h5>Step 1:</h5>
<p>Evil is typically associated with dark, foreboding colors, so when you’re planning a costume for a villainous character, that’s the color palette that you should start with. Black is the traditional option, but any dark shade, such as midnight blue or eggplant, can work well. Opt for clothes that have sleek, clean lines too. For example, a well-tailored suit is an attractive option for a male, while a form-fitting cocktail dress is an ideal costume for a villainess.
Shades of red can work well for an evil costume too because it’s a color usually associated with the Devil. Opt for a bold bright red if your character is outgoing, or a deep maroon or brick red for a more reserved evil look.
Think about the fabrics that you choose for your clothing too. Leather tends to work well for evil characters, so consider incorporating a leather jacket, blazer, or vest in your costume. You can also opt for leather pants or a leather skirt.
If your character’s evilness is a surprise that comes out during a climactic moment, you shouldn’t go with an obvious costume of head to toe black. Instead, give subtle cues with your clothing that your character might be evil, such as a black t-shirt with a basic pair of jeans.</p>
<h5>Step 2:</h5>
<p>When you're planning your costume, you have to take the type of play or scene that you're working in, as well as the time period, into account. For example, while a villain in a Western and an evil character in a futuristic Sci Fi play might both wear black, their outfits will likely be very different otherwise. Make sure your clothing fits the tone and time period for the character’s story.
If you're not entirely sure what's appropriate for your costume, consult movies or TV shows from the same genre for inspiration.
If the play takes place in a specific historical period, you can also do an online search for information about clothing from the era so your costume is historically accurate.</p>
<h5>Step 3:</h5>
<p>While your clothing will probably stand out most about your costume, small details can really help bring your evil look into focus. That’s why you should also find some accessories to help bring your villain to life. For example, edgy jewelry, such as a spiked choker or bracelet, can help give you a sinister look. Leather gloves are another item that can give your character’s costume a more menacing feel.
Your character may require a specialty accessory, such as an eye patch, that can help add to the villainous persona.
Don’t forget weapons, such as a gun or knife, that your character might use to cause harm to others.</p>
<h5>Step 4:</h5>
<p>While a specific character might call for a certain type of voice, villains generally have deep, throaty voice that makes them sound more evil. If you have a naturally deep voice, you probably don’t have to alter it much. However, if your voice tends to be higher-pitched, try to give it a lower, more menacing sound. That means you want to speak from your chest register, so you sound deeper and more threatening.
Identify your chest register by saying the word “whoa” in as deep a voice as you can. Keep your hand on your chest as you speak to feel the vibrations. Repeat the exercise several times. It may help to record yourself, so you can listen back to what your voice sounds like.
If you’re having trouble connecting with your chest register, get down on the floor on all fours with your head down. Say “whoa” in as deep as voice as you can without straining yourself, and concentrate on the vibrations in your chest so you know how you should speak for a deeper sound.
Practice your lines in your deeper voice to get used to speaking that way. You may also want to record yourself saying the lines so you can listen back and make improvements.</p>
